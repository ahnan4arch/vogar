#summary example vogar commands

=Where to run it=

===Running tests on Apache Harmony===
Download and build [http://harmony.apache.org/ Apache Harmony]. Then run:
{{{
vogar \
    --mode host \
    --java-home <harmony>/target/hdk/jdk/ \
    <tests>
}}}

===Running tests on a plain Dalvik VM===
You'll need an [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html Android SDK] and a device or emulator. If you have multiple devices, run `adb devices`, and set the `ANDROID_SERIAL` environment variable to the target's device ID. The device or emulator should be reachable via `adb`, so commands like `adb ls` should work.

Make sure your `PATH` environment variable includes Android development tools like: `adb` and `dx`. You can enter this at the command line for one-time-use, or add it to `~/.bashrc` for durable use.
{{{
export PATH=<sdk>/platforms/android-7/tools/:<sdk>/tools/:$PATH
}}}
Use the `--sdk` option to specify where vogar should look for Android APIs.
{{{
vogar
  --mode device
  --sdk out/target/common/obj/JAVA_LIBRARIES/core_intermediates/classes.jar
  <actions>
}}}


=What to run=

===jtreg tests===
Write or download some [http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg/index.html jtreg] tests! [http://openjdk.java.net/ OpenJDK] includes a large suite of tests for finding bugs in core class libraries. Then point vogar at a source *directory* containing tests.
{{{
vogar <openjdk>/test/java/util/TreeMap/
}}}
Vogar doesn't support prebuilt jtreg tests.

===Caliper benchmarks===
You'll need a benchmark to run. Caliper includes some in its `src/examples` directory. Then point vogar at a benchmark. Be sure to include the `--stream` option, which forces output to be printed:
{{{
vogar --stream <caliper>/src/examples/EnumSetContainsBenchmark.java
}}}

===JUnit tests===
Write some JUnit tests. Every project includes a bunch of these. 
{{{
vogar <android>/dalvik/libcore/xml/src/test/java/tests/xml/DomTest.java
}}}

===Executable Java Programs===
Vogar can run Java programs that have a `public static void main(String[] args)` method. Include the `--stream` option to see the program's output.
{{{
vogar --stream scratch/Main.java
}}}
